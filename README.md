# Final Project

# Saddam Hossain 

# Instructions:
1. I have added all the source code to my final project folder .
2. I have used databricks as a cluster because HPC not allow me to
install all packages I needed.
3. Inside the folder I added all output of the problem, databricks
files, python files, report, video presentation and data sources
5. I have compiled all the code on databricks cluster . So execution
may vary when you test my code .
## Title
# Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) Data Visualization Using Pyspark


# Abstract
Import the data, get all the dates for the outbreak, getting daily
increases and moving averages, convert integer into datetime for
better visualization and graphing the number of confirmed cases,
active cases, deaths, recoveries, mortality rate (CFR), and recovery
rate.

# Problem Definition
Coronavirus data visualization and graphing the number of confirmed
cases, active cases, deaths, recoveries, mortality rate (CFR), and
recovery rate. Showing country specific data.
Big Data Perspectives:
One example is how big data can play a huge role during a pandemic
like Covid 19.
“To help providers detect which patients are most likely to have
severe cases of COVID-19, McDevitt and his team leveraged artificial
intelligence and big data to produce COVID-19 severity scores.
Utilizing data from 160 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, the
researchers identified four biomarkers measured in blood tests that
were significantly elevated in patients who died versus those who
recovered, including the C-reactive protein, myoglobin, procalcitonin,
and cardiac troponin I.” Source: healthitanalytics


# Approach
I have used pyspark for doing the visualization and databricks as a
cluster because our hpc platform does not allow me to install some
packages and libraries I have used in this project.
